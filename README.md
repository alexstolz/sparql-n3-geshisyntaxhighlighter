## GeSHi syntax highlighter for SPARQL and N3/Turtle ##

This project provides a **SPARQL and N3/Turtle** syntax highlighting extension for **GeSHi**, the generic syntax highlighter for PHP. The objective to develop this extension was the lack of syntax highlighting for SPARQL and Turtle in the GeSHi extension of Mediawiki. But the syntax highlighter can just as easily be plugged into any other GeSHi-capable CMS.


N3/Turtle:

SPARQL:

Features:
 * N3/Turtle highlighter extended by SPARQL support,
 * distinction of S, P and O using different colors,
 * recognition of most important N3/Turtle and SPARQL keywords,
 * extra color for SPARQL variables,
 * highlighting of Virtuoso built-in functions, e.g. bif:contains().


This GeSHi extension was developed by the *E-Business and Web Science Research Group* at the *Bundeswehr University Munich*. The project was initiated by Christian FÃ¼rber and carried on by Alex Stolz. It is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2.
